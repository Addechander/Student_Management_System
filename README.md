# Student_Management_System
This project uses Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm to implement a Student Management System. The system keeps track of students' information and their academic performance. 

The system defines a Student Class and keeps records of Name, Roll number,Address, Contact number, and email address. The Student class also has the following methods: 
Constructor, 
Getter
Setter for Address,Contact number, email address. 

The system then uses a method to display all information of the student and creates Test objects of the class Student.
